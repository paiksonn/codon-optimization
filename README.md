# codon-optimization
Open acces code for the scientific work "...".
This work provides two .py files: "sequence_preparations" and "metrics_counter".

First one contains supportative code in which you can read sequence from .txt or .fa files and calculate
some additional data a.e. codon friequence, nucleotide frequence, etc. 

Second one connects data from sequence_preparations.py and cantains main code for metrics calcalations: RCA, RCBS, CPS, CPB, RCSU, ARSCU, GC-friequence.
