# codon-optimization
Open acces code for the scientific work "Study of the dependency of codon optimisation algorithm on the length of the target nucleotide sequence".
This work provides two .py files: "sequence_preparations" and "metrics_counter" plus an additional supplementary file "human_CPS.txt".

First one contains supportative code in which you can read sequence from .txt or .fa files and calculate
some additional data a.e. codon friequence, nucleotide frequence, etc. 

Second one connects data from sequence_preparations.py and cantains main code for metrics calcalations: RCA, RCBS, CPS, CPB, RCSU, ARSCU, GC-friequence. 

All metrics were counted for some hand-made codon-optimized sequences library and storaged along with some analitics and conclusions in "Метрики.xls" file.
